    dis:"This was my first smartphone—a 3G device that introduced me to the world of mobile technology. At the time, I had no real knowledge about specs or features; I bought it simply because it had a bigger display than other phones in its price range. Downloading Games or Apps on 3G was painfully slow, but just having internet access in my pocket felt revolutionary."

    dis:"The iPhone 12 is my current smartphone, and I originally bought it mainly for playing BGMI. Even after 3+ years of use, it continues to perform exceptionally well, and I’m still very happy using it. The camera—especially for video—is impressive, the UI is clean and smooth, and its 5G support adds to the overall experience. What's more, the design has aged gracefully and still looks modern today, closely resembling the look of the recently launched iPhone 16."
